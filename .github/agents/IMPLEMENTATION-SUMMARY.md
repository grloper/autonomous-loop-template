3. **Community Building**:
   - Share agent system with community
   - Get feedback on approach
   - Open-source agent framework

## 💡 Advanced Features (Future)

### Phase 2: AI-Powered Agents
```python
# Example: Research Agent with GPT-4
def research_agent_analyze(question):
    prompt = f"""
    You are the Research Agent, expert in UV physics and gel chemistry.
    
    Question: {question}
    
    Provide evidence-based analysis with sources.
    """
    
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model="gpt-4",
        messages=[{"role": "system", "content": RESEARCH_AGENT_PERSONA},
                  {"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
    )
    
    return response
```

### Phase 3: Autonomous Code Generation
```yaml
# Software Agent generates PRs automatically
- trigger: Issue labeled "agent:software"
- action: 
    1. Analyze requirements
    2. Generate code
    3. Write tests
    4. Create PR
    5. Request reviews from other agents
```

### Phase 4: Multi-Agent Debates
```
Issue: "Should we use 365nm or 405nm UV?"

Research Agent: "365nm cures 2x faster (evidence)"
Hardware Agent: "365nm LEDs cost +$15 (trade-off)"
Safety Agent: "365nm requires better shielding (concern)"

→ Agents debate via comments
→ Voting mechanism
→ Consensus algorithm
→ Decision logged with reasoning
```

## 🤔 FAQs

**Q: Do I need AI API keys for this to work?**  
A: No! The system provides structure and automation. Agents are currently templates that human experts (or AI) follow. You can add GPT-4/Claude later for autonomous intelligence.

**Q: How do agents "talk" to each other?**  
A: Via GitHub issue comments, PR reviews, and discussions. Each agent posts analysis, others respond.

**Q: Can I disable specific agents?**  
A: Yes! Remove labels or modify workflow conditions.

**Q: How do I add a new agent?**  
A: Create `[agent]-agent.md`, add workflow job, create issue template, update router.

**Q: Is this really multi-agent or just automated comments?**  
A: Currently structured automation + human expertise. Future: Add AI models for true autonomous agents.
