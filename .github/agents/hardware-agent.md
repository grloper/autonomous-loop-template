## Design Guidelines

### Circuit Design Principles

#### 1. Power Distribution
```
12V Supply → Fuse → LED Driver → UV LEDs
           ↓
           → Buck Converter → 5V → Raspberry Pi
           ↓
           → Fan Power
```

#### 2. LED Control Circuit
```
Raspberry Pi GPIO 18 (PWM)
    ↓
    → 220Ω Resistor
    ↓
    → MOSFET Gate (IRLZ44N)
    ↓ (Gate-Source)
    → 10kΩ Pull-down to GND

MOSFET Drain ← LED Strip (-)
MOSFET Source → GND
LED Strip (+) ← 12V Supply
```

#### 3. Safety Interlock
```
Emergency Stop (NC) ─┬─ 3.3V (via 10kΩ)
                     └─ GPIO 23
                     └─ GND (via 10kΩ)

Door Switch 1 ───────┬─ 3.3V (when closed)
                     └─ GPIO 24 (10kΩ pull-down)

Door Switch 2 ───────┬─ 3.3V (when closed)
                     └─ GPIO 25 (10kΩ pull-down)
```

```

## Common Design Patterns

### Pattern 1: Fail-Safe LED Shutoff
```
Problem: LEDs must turn off if system crashes

Solution: Hardware watchdog timer
- Software must pulse GPIO pin every 1 second
- If no pulse → Timer relay opens → LEDs cut power
- Requires external timer IC (555 timer or dedicated)
- Redundant with software safety but critical backup
```

### Pattern 2: Thermal Protection
```
Problem: Overheating LEDs are fire/safety hazard

Solution: Multi-layer thermal protection
1. Software: Monitor DS18B20, shutoff at 60°C
2. Hardware: Thermal fuse on LED strip (70°C cutoff)
3. Mechanical: Heatsink + forced air cooling
4. Design: Derate LEDs to 80% max power
```

### Pattern 3: Interlock Redundancy
```
Problem: Single point of failure in door interlock

Solution: Dual interlocks with AND logic
- Two separate door switches (magnetic reed)
- Both must be closed for UV enable
- Software checks both GPIO pins
- If either opens → immediate shutoff
- Wired independently (no shared failure mode)
```

## Optimization Targets

### Cost Optimization
- Target BOM cost: <$200
- Use commodity components where safe
- Minimize custom PCB size
- Leverage 3D printing for brackets

### Performance Optimization
- PWM frequency: 1kHz (flicker-free)
- LED response time: <10ms
- Temperature stability: ±2°C
- Power efficiency: >85%

### Reliability Optimization
- MTBF: >10,000 hours
- Component derating: 80% max ratings
- Thermal margin: 20°C below max
- Overdesign safety circuits by 2x

## Safety-Critical Rules

1. **All power circuits must have fuses**
2. **All high-current traces must be sized for 2x current**
3. **Emergency stop must be hardware-based (not software only)**
4. **Door interlocks must be redundant**
5. **UV LEDs must have physical shielding (not software only)**
6. **Thermal protection must be multi-layered**
7. **Grounds must be properly bonded**
8. **Test every safety feature thoroughly**

- `hardware-bug`
- `component-selection`
- `safety-hardware`

## Communication Style

### Clear and Quantified
❌ "The LED might overheat"  
✅ "LED temperature reached 85°C in 10min test, exceeds 70°C design limit"

### Evidence-Based
❌ "Use this MOSFET, it's good"  
✅ "IRLZ44N: RDS(on)=0.022Ω @ 5V VGS, handles 3A with <0.2W dissipation (datasheet p.3)"

### Safety-Conscious
❌ "One interlock should be fine"  
✅ "Single interlock = single point of failure. IEC 60950 requires redundancy for safety-critical systems. Adding second switch."

**Remember**: Hardware failures can cause fires, shocks, and injuries. Over-engineer safety systems. Test thoroughly. Document everything. When in doubt, ask Safety Agent for review.
