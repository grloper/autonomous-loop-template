## 📊 Understanding the Strategic Report

After each run, Orchestrator posts a report:

### Report Structure
```markdown
# 🎯 Orchestrator Strategic Report

## 📈 Executive Summary
Quick overview of findings and actions

## 🎯 Top Priority Actions  
Ranked list of next tasks

## 🛡️ Safety Status
Critical safety assessment

## 💡 Strategic Insights
Patterns, learnings, recommendations

## 📋 Issues Created
Links to new issues

## 🔄 Next Actions
Short/medium/long-term roadmap

## 📊 Project Health Metrics
Safety, testing, documentation scores

## 🎓 Orchestrator Learning
What's working, what needs improvement
```

### Where to Find Reports
- **Discussions tab**: Permanent archive
- **Actions artifacts**: JSON data files
- **Workflow logs**: Detailed console output

---

## 🎛️ Advanced: Customize the Orchestrator

### Change Weekly Schedule

Edit `.github/workflows/orchestrator-button.yml`:

```yaml
schedule:
  - cron: '0 8 * * 1'  # Monday 8am UTC

# Change to:
  - cron: '0 14 * * 3'  # Wednesday 2pm UTC
```

### Adjust Task Creation Limits

In the workflow, find:

```python
for task in tasks[:3]:  # Create top 3 priorities
```

Change to:

```python
for task in tasks[:5]:  # Create top 5 priorities
```

### Focus on Specific Areas

When clicking THE BUTTON, choose:
- **Focus: safety** - Only safety-critical analysis
- **Focus: software** - Code quality only
- **Focus: hardware** - Electronics only

### Add Custom Checks

Edit `.github/agents/orchestrator-agent.md` to add:
- Custom code patterns to detect
- Specific metrics to track
- Additional research topics
- Custom priority algorithms

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Button Not Working

**Check 1**: Workflows enabled?
```
Settings → Actions → General → Allow all actions
```

**Check 2**: File exists?
```powershell
ls .github/workflows/orchestrator-button.yml
```

**Check 3**: Valid YAML?
Go to Actions tab, see if workflow is listed

### No Issues Created

**Reason 1**: May not have found high-priority work
- Check workflow logs for analysis results

**Reason 2**: Issues might already exist
- Orchestrator won't create duplicates

**Reason 3**: Permission error
- Check `GITHUB_TOKEN` has `issues: write` permission

### Report Not Posted

**Reason**: Discussions may not be enabled
- Go to Settings → General → Features → Enable Discussions
- Report still saved as artifact if posting fails

### Agents Not Responding

**Current Limitation**: Agents post structured comments but need AI integration
- See `.github/agents/AI-INTEGRATION.md` to add GPT-4/Claude
- Without AI, agents provide templates and workflows
- With AI (~$5/month), agents become fully autonomous

---

## 🎓 Best Practices

### When to Click THE BUTTON

**Good times**:
- Start of a new sprint/week
- After major milestone completed
- When feeling stuck or unclear on priorities
- Emergency: something broke, need rapid assessment
- Monthly: strategic review and planning

**Don't need to click**:
- It runs automatically every week
- Only click for urgent/unscheduled reviews

### How Often to Run

**Recommended**:
- Automatic weekly runs (default)
- Manual runs only when needed

**Avoid**:
- Daily runs (too frequent, creates noise)
- Multiple runs in same day (wastes resources)

### Reading the Reports

**Focus on**:
1. Safety Status (always read this first)
2. Top 3 priority actions
3. Strategic insights
4. Next actions timeline

**Can skip**:
- Detailed metrics (unless debugging)
- Full task list (focus on top priorities)

## 💡 Pro Tips

### 1. Trust the Orchestrator
It analyzes more thoroughly than you can manually. If it says something is priority 1, it probably is.

### 2. Let Agents Collaborate
Don't micromanage. The orchestrator assigns multiple agents to complex tasks for a reason.

### 3. Review Weekly Reports
Set a calendar reminder: "Read Orchestrator report every Monday morning"

### 4. Act on Safety Issues
If Orchestrator flags safety concerns, drop everything and fix them first.

### 5. Celebrate Progress
Each week, compare new report to last week. You'll see measurable progress!
