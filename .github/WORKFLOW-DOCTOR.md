# Workflow Doctor üè• - Self-Healing GitHub Actions

## Overview

**Workflow Doctor** is an automated system that monitors GitHub Actions workflows, diagnoses failures, and **automatically fixes common issues** without human intervention. It's your 24/7 DevOps assistant that keeps the CI/CD pipeline healthy.

## Key Features

### 1. **Automatic Failure Detection** üîç
- Monitors all GitHub Actions workflows in real-time
- Triggers immediately when any workflow fails
- Can also be manually triggered for historical failures

### 2. **Intelligent Diagnosis** üß†
- Pattern-matches error messages to identify root causes
- Recognizes common failure types:
  - ‚ùå Missing permissions (403 errors)
  - ‚ùå Syntax errors in YAML
  - ‚ùå Missing secrets/environment variables
  - ‚ùå Python dependency issues
  - ‚ùå Workflow timeouts

### 3. **Auto-Fix Capabilities** üîß
Some issues can be fixed automatically:
- ‚úÖ **Permissions**: Adds missing `permissions:` blocks to workflow files
- ‚úÖ **Dependencies**: Updates `requirements.txt` (basic cases)
- ‚úÖ **Timeouts**: Adds `timeout-minutes:` configuration
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Syntax/Secrets**: Requires manual intervention (creates issue)

### 4. **Pull Request Automation** ü§ñ
When auto-fix is possible:
- Creates a new branch (`auto-fix/workflow-<timestamp>`)
- Applies the fix
- Opens a pull request with detailed explanation
- Labels: `automated-fix`, `workflow-doctor`

### 5. **Manual Review Workflow** üìã
When manual intervention is needed:
- Creates a GitHub issue with diagnosis
- Provides specific recommendations
- Links to relevant documentation
- Labels: `workflow-failure`, `needs-review`, `automated-diagnosis`

    E --> H[Create PR with Fix]
    F --> H
    G --> I[Manual Review Required]
    H --> J[Ready to Merge]
```

## Usage

### Automatic Mode (Default)

Workflow Doctor runs automatically on every workflow failure. No action needed!

### Manual Mode (Troubleshooting)

To diagnose a specific workflow run:

```bash
gh workflow run workflow-doctor.yml -f run_id=<RUN_ID>
```

Example:
```bash
gh workflow run workflow-doctor.yml -f run_id=18956567665
```

## Configuration

### Monitored Workflows

Currently monitors:
- ‚úÖ Multi-Agent Collaboration System
- ‚úÖ Orchestrator - Autonomous Project Lead

To add more workflows, edit `.github/workflows/workflow-doctor.yml`:

```yaml
on:
  workflow_run:
    workflows: 
      - "Multi-Agent Collaboration System"
      - "Orchestrator - Autonomous Project Lead"
      - "Your New Workflow Name"  # Add here
    types: 
      - completed
```

### Permissions Required

Workflow Doctor needs these permissions:

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: write       # To create fix branches
  pull-requests: write  # To create PRs
  issues: write         # To create diagnostic issues
  actions: read         # To read workflow logs
```

## Supported Failure Types

### 1. Permission Errors (Auto-Fixable ‚úÖ)

**Symptoms:**
- 403 errors
- "Resource not accessible by integration"
- "x-accepted-github-permissions: ..."

**Auto-Fix:**
Adds the following to workflow file:
```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read
  issues: write
  pull-requests: write
```

**Example PR Title:**
> ü§ñ Auto-Fix: Missing Workflow Permissions

### 2. Dependency Errors (Partial Auto-Fix ‚ö†Ô∏è)

**Symptoms:**
- `ModuleNotFoundError`
- "No module named X"
- `pip install` failures

**Auto-Fix:**
- Basic: Adds missing package to `requirements.txt`
- Complex: Creates issue with recommendations

### 3. Timeout Errors (Auto-Fixable ‚úÖ)

**Symptoms:**
- "exceeded the maximum execution time"
- Job cancelled after long run

**Auto-Fix:**
Adds timeout configuration:
```yaml
jobs:
  my-job:
    timeout-minutes: 30  # Added by Workflow Doctor
```

### 4. Syntax Errors (Manual Review Required ‚ùå)

**Symptoms:**
- "Invalid workflow file"
- YAML parsing errors

**Action:**
Creates issue with:
- Exact error location
- Syntax validation tips
- Link to YAML validator tools

### 5. Missing Secrets (Manual Review Required ‚ùå)

**Symptoms:**
- "Secret XYZ not found"
- Authentication failures

**Action:**
Creates issue instructing how to add secrets via:
- Repository Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions

## Advanced Features

### Custom Failure Patterns

Add your own patterns to `.github/scripts/workflow_doctor.py`:

```python
FAILURE_PATTERNS = {
    'custom_issue': {
        'patterns': [
            r'Your custom error regex',
            r'Another pattern',
        ],
        'auto_fixable': True,
        'fix_function': 'fix_custom_issue'
    }
}
```

Then implement the fix function:

```python
def fix_custom_issue(self):
    """Auto-fix: Your custom fix logic"""
    print("üîß Applying custom fix...")
    # Your fix code here
    return True
```

### Notification Integration

To get Slack/email notifications on failures, add to workflow:

```yaml
- name: Notify on Failure
  if: failure()
  uses: 8398a7/action-slack@v3
  with:
    status: ${{ job.status }}
    text: 'Workflow Doctor found an issue'
    webhook_url: ${{ secrets.SLACK_WEBHOOK }}
```

## Testing Workflow Doctor

### Simulate a Failure

1. Create a test workflow with intentional error:
```yaml
# .github/workflows/test-failure.yml
name: Test Workflow Doctor
on: workflow_dispatch
jobs:
  fail:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: exit 1
```

2. Trigger it:
```bash
gh workflow run test-failure.yml
```

3. Watch Workflow Doctor activate automatically

### Manual Diagnosis

Test diagnosis on an existing failure:

```bash
# Get recent failed runs
gh run list --status failure --limit 5

# Diagnose specific run
gh workflow run workflow-doctor.yml -f run_id=<RUN_ID>
```

## Maintenance

### Update Failure Patterns

As you encounter new failure types:

1. Document the error in `workflow_doctor.py` patterns
2. Implement fix function if auto-fixable
3. Test with historical failures
4. Commit and push

### Monitor Doctor Health

Check Workflow Doctor's own runs:

```bash
gh run list --workflow=workflow-doctor.yml
```

If Workflow Doctor itself fails:
- Check permissions
- Verify Python dependencies
- Review error logs manually

## Limitations

### What Workflow Doctor CANNOT Do

‚ùå Fix complex logic errors in your code  
‚ùå Resolve infrastructure issues (GitHub outages)  
‚ùå Add missing repository secrets (security restriction)  
‚ùå Fix test failures (application logic)  
‚ùå Rewrite incorrect business logic  

### What Workflow Doctor CAN Do

‚úÖ Fix workflow configuration issues  
‚úÖ Add missing permissions automatically  
‚úÖ Update dependency lists  
‚úÖ Optimize timeout settings  
‚úÖ Provide diagnostic information for complex issues  

## Troubleshooting

### "Workflow Doctor didn't trigger"

**Causes:**
- Workflow Doctor workflow is disabled
- Monitored workflow name doesn't match
- Event type not configured

**Solution:**
1. Check `.github/workflows/workflow-doctor.yml` exists
2. Verify workflow names in `on.workflow_run.workflows` list
3. Ensure permissions are granted

### "Auto-fix PR created but fix is wrong"

**Causes:**
- Pattern matched incorrectly
- Fix logic has bug

**Solution:**
1. Close the PR
2. Update `workflow_doctor.py` fix function
3. Test manually with `python .github/scripts/workflow_doctor.py`
4. Re-trigger on original failure

### "Workflow Doctor says 'Manual review required' for everything"

**Causes:**
- Failure patterns don't match new error types
- Log parsing is failing

**Solution:**
1. Review failed workflow logs manually
2. Add new patterns to `FAILURE_PATTERNS` dict
3. Update pattern regex to match your errors

## Integration with Other Systems

### Orchestrator Agent

Workflow Doctor complements the Orchestrator Agent:

```
Orchestrator ‚Üí Plans & Creates Tasks
       ‚Üì
Multi-Agent System ‚Üí Executes Work
       ‚Üì (if fails)
Workflow Doctor ‚Üí Auto-Fixes & Retries
       ‚Üì
System Self-Heals ‚úÖ
```

### Monitoring Dashboard

Track Doctor effectiveness:

```bash
# Count auto-fixed issues
gh pr list --label automated-fix --state merged

# Count manual reviews needed
gh issue list --label workflow-failure --state open
```

## Future Enhancements

Planned features:

- [ ] **Smart Retry**: Auto-retry failed workflows after fix
- [ ] **Learning System**: ML to recognize new failure patterns
- [ ] **Cost Optimization**: Detect expensive workflow operations
- [ ] **Performance Monitoring**: Track workflow execution times
- [ ] **Security Scanning**: Detect security anti-patterns
